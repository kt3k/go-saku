> Markdown-based task runner

`saku` is a simple task runner based on markdown syntax. You can define and describe your tasks in markdown file `saku.md` and execute them with `saku` command.

(You can optionally define tasks in `README.md`. See [The below](#embed-sakumd-in-readmemd) for details.)

:bookmark: More background stories are explained in [an article](https://dev.to/kt3k/markdown-based-task-runner---saku-239o).

# :cd: Install

**Go users**

    go get -u github.com/kt3k/saku

**Mac OS users**

    brew install kt3k/tap/saku

Or download binary from the [release page][].

# :leaves: Usage

First, create a markdown file `saku.md`:

````markdown
# build
> Build the go binary.

    go build -v -i main.go

# test
> Run all the go tests.

    go test -race ./...

# js

    minify -o public/script.js src/js

# css

    minify -o public/style.css src/css
````

The above defines 4 tasks `build` `test` `js` `css`. (A heading (#) is a task title!)

If you hit `saku` (without arguments) it shows the list of the descriptions of the all tasks.

If you hit the command `saku build`, it invokes `build` task, `go build -v -i main.go` in the above example.

**Note**: 4-space or tab indent makes code block in markdown syntax. See [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode)

````markdown
    echo hello
    echo world
````

The above makes the code block of the 2 lines `echo hello` and `echo world`.

# `saku.md` Rules

- Heading (# title) starts the task definition.
  - Different levels of headings (#, ##, ###,...) forms the groups of tasks. Tasks of the lower level headings belong to the previous task which has the upper level heading. See below for the details.
- Code blocks are commands.
  - Code blocks can have multiple commands. They will be executed sequentially.
- Blockquotes are description of the task.
- Anything else is ignored.
- Anything before the first heading is ignored.

For example:

````markdown
# build
> Build the go binary.

    echo Starting build go binary
    go build -v -i main.go
````

The above defines the task `build`, which has the description `Build the go binary.`. It has two commands `echo Starting build go binary` and `go build -v -i main.go` and they run in sequence.

## Parallel execution

With `-p, --parallel` option, you can run tasks in parallel like the below:

```
saku -p watch-scripts run-server
```

## Race execution

With `-r, --race` option, you can run tasks in parallel and terminate tasks when the first task finished. This is useful for testing servers.

This option takes effect only when `-p` option is specified.

```
saku -p -r run-server test-server
```

## Grouping tasks

You can create the group of tasks by the levels of headings.

For example:

````markdown
# foo

## bar

    echo bar

## baz

    echo baz
````

This defines 3 task `foo`, `bar` and `baz`. `foo` becomes the parent of `bar` and `baz`. So when you invoke `saku foo`, it executes both `bar` and `baz`:

```console
$ saku foo
[saku] Run foo
[saku] foo > Run bar, baz in sequence
+echo bar
bar
+echo baz
baz
[saku] foo > Finish bar, baz in sequence
[saku] ✨  Finish foo
```

The tasks of the lower level headings belong to the upper level heading and which forms the groups of tasks.

## Use parallel in task grouping

If you need to run the children tasks in parallel, you can use `<!-- saku parallel -->` directive in the parents' contents:

````markdown
# foo

<!-- saku parallel -->

## bar

    echo bar

## baz

    echo baz
````

This executes `bar` and `baz` in parallel:

```console
$ saku foo
[saku] Run foo
[saku] foo > Run bar, baz in parallel
+echo bar
+echo baz
bar
baz
[saku] foo > Finish bar, baz in parallel
[saku] ✨  Finish foo
```

## Nesting tasks (Dependency of tasks)

You can use `saku` in `saku.md` like below:

````markdown
# dist

    saku js minify

# js

    browserify src/main.js > build/app.js

# minify

    uglify-js < build/app.js > build/app.min.js
````

In this way, you can express the dependencies of tasks.

If you need to invoke tasks in parallel from another task, use `saku -p`.

````markdown
# start

    saku -p serve watch

# watch

    my-watcher

# serve

    my-server
````

# CLI Usage

```
Usage: saku [options] <task, ...> [-- extra-options]

Options:
  -v, --version   - - - Shows the version number and exits.
  -h, --help  - - - - - Shows the help message and exits.
  -i, --info  - - - - - Shows the task information and exits.
  -p, --parallel  - - - Runs tasks in parallel. Default false.
  -s, --sequential  - - Runs tasks in serial. Default true.
  -c, --config <path> - Specifies the config file. Default is 'saku.md'.
  -r, --race  - - - - - Sets the flag to kill all tasks when a task
                        finished with zero. This option is valid only
                        with 'parallel' option.
  -q, --quiet   - - - - Prints less messages.

The extra options after '--' are passed to each task command.
```

# Notes

## Embed `saku.md` in `README.md`

You can optionally embed `saku.md` in `README.md`. See the below for details.

README.md

````markdown
# Development

These are the commands for development. You can invoke them with `saku` command.

<!-- saku start -->

## build

    go build -v -i main.go

## test

    go test -race ./...

<!-- saku end -->
````

The contents between `<!-- saku start -->` and `<!-- saku end -->` are used as `saku.md`. You can write them as if they are the part of your `README.md`.

## Example use cases

- [moneybit-app](https://github.com/kt3k/moneybit-app)'s [saku.md](https://github.com/kt3k/moneybit-app/blob/master/saku.md)
  - A project of accounting app for mobile, written in JavaScript.

**Note**: Please add yours if you use saku in your OSS project!

## The origin of the name

Saku is the Japanese name for the Chinese character "作", which means "make". Saku is intended to be an alternative of `make` command (of a task runner use case).
